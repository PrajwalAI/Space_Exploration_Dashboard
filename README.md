## Insights & Discussion
1. China has the highest environmental impact and germany has the lowest overall impact.
2. India has a slightly higher success rate(76%) with the average mission duration of 177 days.
3. Manned missions have higher success rates whereas unmanned missions have lower environmental impact.
4. Despite having a lower budget UAE achieved a comparable success rate to countries with higher success rate.
5. In technologies used, AI navigation proves to be the most environment friendly.
6. Traditional Rocket technology had lower costs but also lower success rates.
7. Missions with low environmental impact often have higher costs or longer durations.

## Recommendations
1. Invest more in AI Navigation missions.
2. Reduce dependence on high-impact technologies.
3. Collaborate with india for higher success rate, germany for lower environmental impact and UAE for budget friendly outputs.
4. Unmanned mission should be preferred because, they have a shorter mission duration as well as lower environmental impact compared to manned missions.


## Conclusion
In summary, the dataset reveals that successful and sustainable space exploration depends not just on budget but also on technology choice and collaboration. Countries like India, Germany, and the UAE demonstrate valuable strengths in efficiency, environmental responsibility, and cost-effectiveness. By leveraging these insights, stakeholders can optimize future missions for better outcomes and global impact.
